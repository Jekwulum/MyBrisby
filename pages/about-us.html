          <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Our goal at myBrisby is to provide new students moving to Brisbane with all the support and help they need.
            All
            new students to the city are encouraged to have a sense of belonging in an environment that we work hard to
            build. Our aim is for every student to feel encouraged and empowered to excel in both their academic and
            extracurricular efforts. We are dedicated to offering the tools and advice required to make the move as easy
            as
            possible because we recognize that moving to a new city can be overwhelming.

          <span class="about-welcome">Welcome to myBrisby!</span>

          At myBrisby, we are committed to making your transition to Brisbane as seamless and enjoyable as possible. We
          understand that starting university or college in a new city can be overwhelming, which is why we are here to
          help.

          Our primary focus is on assisting new students with accommodation, support services, airport pickup, and
          community linking. We believe that having a comfortable place to live, access to helpful resources, a smooth
          airport arrival, and a supportive community can significantly enhance your overall experience as a student.

          <span><a href="#">Accommodation:</a></span> Finding suitable accommodation is crucial, and we are here to
          guide you through
          the process. We
          provide information on various housing options, including on-campus residences, off-campus rentals, and
          homestays. Our goal is to help you find a safe and comfortable place that suits your preferences and budget.

          <span><a href="#">Support Services:</a></span> We understand that adjusting to a new environment can be
          challenging. That's why we offer a
          range of support services to ensure you have the assistance you need. From academic support and counseling

          unfamiliar with the city. Our airport pickup service ensures a warm welcome as soon as you land. We will
          arrange for a friendly and knowledgeable representative to greet you, assist with your luggage, and help you
          get settled in your new accommodation.

          backgrounds, share experiences, and create a supportive network.
